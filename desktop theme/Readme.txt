Theme credits go to @Nyxkrage https://github.com/nyxkrage/st-discord-inspired/releases

I have modified the theme to be darker overall and modifed the chat window/topbar for better clarity and screenspace for use with vrm, also added in a movingUI preset.

Instructions:
place "Discord Dark MUI.json" inside of Sillytavern/public/movingUI
place "Discord Dark.json" inside of Sillytavern/public/themes
Select Theme and Moving UI preset in tavern
Enjoy!
