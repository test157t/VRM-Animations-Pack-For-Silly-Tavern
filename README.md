This a repo containing 111 animations for use in SillyTaverns VRM extension, they use modified rigs to work properly. (Not just any BVH or fbx will work) 
Get the extension from here https://github.com/SillyTavern/Extension-VRM Thank @keiji for all his hard work!.
Get animations from mixamo.com
Convert using https://github.com/ButzYung/SystemAnimatorOnline and export as bvh for compatibility with the extension.
Have fun, and remember praise @keiji for not only putting up with me- but all the time and effort he has spent to make this possible for all of you.
